    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>When is the last time you had a pumpkin cream cheese muffin? Probably during fall time right? To dig deeper, where did you have this muffin?
        Was it in the car, on the way home or to work, after stopping by Starbucks the day they launched their fall menu? I thought so. So, instead
         of having this muffin in one hand, with the other hand on the wheel, swirving on the road as crumbs of muffin fall onto your lap, how about you enjoy
         it in the comfort of your own home. Even better, for a quarter of the price, and a fridge of a baker's dozen. This recipe is going to teach you the way of the beloved 
         Starbucks pumpkin muffin. It's an art, a martial art form if you will, but an easy one, and one that makes fall time that much better.
