    <p>Can you tell me what your biggest regret is? <strong>I can.</strong> It was going to the store, grabbing some 
        banana bread, and taking it into my <strong>OWN</strong> home, <strong><em>JUST TO HAVE NUTS IN IT!!</em></strong>
        This recipe will redeem what others have created, and call "banana bread." (And don't get me started on nuts in brownies).
