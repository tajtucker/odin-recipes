This is my first HTML project designed to take users from one .html page to another, showing varying recipes and images.

Over the course of this project, I will be adding detailed outlines for my recipes, I will be adding pictures with the correct format, and make the website accessible to anyone using a screen reader. I plan to have multiple links, which include relative, and absolute links. The same will apply for the images I use.

I will be eventually styling this project with CSS.

Last quick note: I will be accessing, creating, and editing all files via macOS terminal. There will be no help from IDE's. (This is written via VScode).
