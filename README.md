This is my first HTML/CSS project. It is designed to take users from one recipe page to another, showing different recipes and images, all accessible from the home page, with a nice fall theme added to it.

This project uses relative links to display the images for each recipe, as well as ordered and unordered lists for the instructions and ingredients. It also includes emphasis elements, strong elements, and anchor elements to link to each recipe and back to the home page.

As for CSS, this project includes, margins, padding, borders, as well as different colors and block displays.

Last quick note: I accessed, created, and edited all files and directories via the macOS terminal using Git. There was no help from IDEs. (This project was written in VS Code.)
